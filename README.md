# portfolio

Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

So for my final I wanted to take some feedback I recieved in my UX class and adjust my porfoilio accordingly. So, when you compare my Web Develepment final to my UX you'll see some minor changes.  Another thing I wanted to do was incorporate some of the elements I had on my Content Management Systems portfolio.
