# portfolio

Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

Initially, I developed low-fidelity and high-fidelity Figma prototypes, providing a solid foundation for the design and layout of my portfolio. Transitioning from these designs to actual code involved utilizing Bootstrap, with some personal adjustments, to craft the various pages.

However, the process wasn't without its challenges. One significant hurdle was refining my coded site to better reflect a portfolio rather than a business-oriented website - which I feel that I haven't full succeed in doing and I hope to make more deliberate changes to the design and content to showcase my work and skills effectively.

Additionally, I incorporated feedback received from my UX class into my final project, such as making my site less text heavy and more content/image orientated, resulting in minor adjustments aimed at enhancing the overall user experience and design of my coded site.

Ensuring that my coded site closely mirrored my Figma prototype was another challenge, requiring meticulous attention to detail and iterative adjustments to achieve the desired outcome. While it wasn't necessary to achieve pixel-perfect precision, maintaining visual alignment was crucial for your evaluation purposes.

Through this process, I gained valuable insights and skills. I learned the importance of planning and re-planning, design, and how to incorporate feedback to create a cohesive and visually appealing website for all users. Moreover, overcoming challenges taught me resilience and problem-solving skills applicable to future projects.

By integrating feedback and drawing from past projects, I created a web portfolio that not only showcased my skills and experiences but also reflected my growth as a developer and designer. This iterative approach not only improved the final product but also contributed to my continuous learning and development in the field of web development and user experience design.
